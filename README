To compile private, if cloned from gitlab:

autoreconf
libtoolize
automake --add-missing
autoreconf

Then ./configure and make install

If configure fails, it may be that autoconf did not find the macro
file ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4.  In that case copy it from the base
directory to the m4 directory.
