Redistribution or modfication of tsim is forbidden.

You should have received this package directly from the author. If
this is not the case, you are in posession of an unauthorized copy and
should delete it immediately.

If you received tsim from the author, it is understood that it is to
be used under scientific collaboration with the author for a specific
project. You may not use it outside this project.

You can use this package under the terms of the project and, if you
have so agreed with the author, modify it or write new code based on
it. This new code is also understood to be used only under the
project. You of course retain your rights over the code you have
written, but since it in principle depends on tsim's code, you should
discuss uses of this code (by yourself or others) outside the project
with tsim's author.

If you would like to make use of this package other than set forth
here, you must obtain permission in writing from the author.
